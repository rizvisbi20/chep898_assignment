#Analysis Plan: 

Prediction of New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Using ECG Data

## 1. Goals & Key Questions

### Primary Goal: 
Develop a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of new-onset AF using routine 12-lead ECG variables.

### Key Questions:

Which ECG features (e.g., P-wave duration, PR interval) are most predictive of AF?
How do clinical variables (age, sex, hypertension) interact with ECG metrics?
Can a simple model (e.g., logistic regression) achieve clinically actionable performance?

## 2. Tools & Workflow

Version Control & Collaboration:


data/: Raw and cleaned datasets.
notebooks/: RStudiofor Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA), modeling, and visualization.
scripts/: R scripts for reusable functions (e.g., preprocessing).
reports/: Final outputs (PDFs, slides, or dashboards).


Scientific Computing:

Languages: R (Tidyverse).
Environment: RStudio for reproducibility.

3. Step-by-Step Plan

Phase 1: Data Cleaning & EDA

Data Loading & Inspection:
Load raw data and check for inconsistencies.
Document missing values, outliers, and data types.
Preprocessing:
Handle missing data (impute based on missingness patterns).
Normalize ECG variables (e.g., heart-rate-adjusted QT interval).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., Sex → 0/1).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Summarize distributions of key variables (histograms, boxplots).
Check for class imbalance in the target (New-onset AF).
Analyze correlations between ECG features and AF (heatmaps, scatterplots).

Phase 2: Feature Engineering & Modeling

Feature Engineering:
Derive new metrics (e.g., P-wave dispersion = max P-wave – min P-wave).
Split data into training/test sets (stratified by AF incidence).
Model Development:
Baseline Model: Logistic regression with key ECG/clinic variables.
Advanced Models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing approach for predicting 
new-onset AF using ECG and clinical variables.
